## Status Flow
```
pending → submitted → in_review → approved → design → design_review → design_approved → development → dev_review → dev_complete → testing → qa_complete → launch → completed
```

## Usage in Database
Update the `status` column in your `applications` table with any of these values:

```sql
-- Example updates
UPDATE applications SET status = 'design' WHERE order_id = 'WC-20241215-001';
UPDATE applications SET status = 'development' WHERE order_id = 'WC-20241215-002';
UPDATE applications SET status = 'completed' WHERE order_id = 'WC-20241215-003';
```
